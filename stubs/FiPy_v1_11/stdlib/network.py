        Beyond the `arg` a tuple (called `data` ) is also passed to `handler` . The tuple consists of (event, value), where `event` is the triggering event and `value` is the value strictly belonging to the `event` .
        
        
        We recommend getting both the `event` and new `value` of the characteristic via this tuple, and not via `characteristic.event()` and `characteristic.value()` calls in the context of the `handler` to make sure no event and value is lost.
        The reason behind this is that `characteristic.event()` and `characteristic.value()` return with the very last event received and with the current value of the characteristic, while the input parameters are always linked to the specific event triggering the `handler` . If the device is busy executing other operations,  the `handler` of an incoming event may not be called before the next event occurs and is processed.

        Gets an named tuple with the advertisement data received during the scanning. The tuple has the following structure: `(mac, addr_type, adv_type, rssi, data) `
        
        
        
        - `mac `is the 6-byte ling mac address of the device that sent the advertisement. 
        
        - `addr_type `is the address type. See the constants section below for more details. 
        
        - `adv_type `is the advertisement type received. See the constants section below fro more details. 
        
        - `rssi `is signed integer with the signal strength of the advertisement. 
        
        - `data `contains the complete 31 bytes of the advertisement message. In order to parse the data and get the specific types, the method `resolve_adv_data() `can be used. 
        
        
        
        Example for getting `mac `address of an advertiser:
        
        ```python
        import ubinascii
        
        bluetooth = Bluetooth()
        bluetooth.start_scan(20) # scan for 20 seconds

        Configures a new PIN to be used by the device. The PIN is a 1-6 digit length decimal number, if less than 6 digits are given the missing leading digits are considered as 0. E.g. 1234 becomes 001234. When a new PIN is configured, the information of all previously bonded device is removed and the current connection is terminated.
