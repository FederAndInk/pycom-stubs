        - `trigger` can be `Bluetooth.CHAR_NOTIFY_EVENT`.

        Beyond the `arg` a tuple (called `data` ) is also passed to `handler` . The tuple consists of (event, value), where `event` is the triggering event and `value` is the value strictly belonging to the `event` .
        
        
        We recommend getting both the `event` and new `value` of the characteristic via this tuple, and not via `characteristic.event()` and `characteristic.value()` calls in the context of the `handler` to make sure no event and value is lost.
        The reason behind this is that `characteristic.event()` and `characteristic.value()` return with the very last event received and with the current value of the characteristic, while the input parameters are always linked to the specific event triggering the `handler` . If the device is busy executing other operations,  the `handler` of an incoming event may not be called before the next event occurs and is processed.

        - `mac `is the 6-byte ling mac address of the device that sent the advertisement. 
        
        - `addr_type `is the address type. See the constants section below for more details.

        - `rssi `is signed integer with the signal strength of the advertisement. 
        
        - `data `contains the complete 31 bytes of the advertisement message. In order to parse the data and get the specific types, the method `resolve_adv_data() `can be used. 
        
        
        
        Example for getting `mac `address of an advertiser:
        
        ```python

        In `LoRa.LORAWAN` mode, only `adr` , `public` , `tx_retries` and `device_class` are used. All the other params will be ignored as they are handled by the LoRaWAN stack directly. On the other hand, in `LoRa.LORA` mode from those 4 arguments, only the public one is important in order to program the sync word. In `LoRa.LORA` mode `adr` , `tx_retries` and `device_class` are ignored since they are only relevant to the LoRaWAN stack.

        - `sftx` tells the data rate (in the case of LORAWAN mode) or the spreading factor (in the case of LORA mode) of the last packet transmitted. 
        - `tx_trials` is the number of tx attempts of the last transmitted packet (only relevant for LORAWAN confirmed packets).

        The arguments are:
        
        - `index` : Index of the channel to add. Accepts values between 0 and 15 for EU and between 0 and 71 for US. 
        - `frequency` : Centre frequency in Hz of the channel.

        - `LoRa.TX_PACKET_EVENT` is raised as soon as the packet transmission cycle ends, which includes the end of the receive windows. In the case of non-confirmed transmissions, this will occur at the end of the receive windows, but, in the case of confirmed transmissions, this event will only be raised if the `ack` is received. 
        - `LoRa.TX_FAILED_EVENT` will be raised after the number of `tx_retries` configured have been performed and no `ack` is received.

        - `255` means that the end-device was not able to measure the battery level.
